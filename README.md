# Food Pull

Decades of environmental neglect have crippled Earth's ability to grow food. Humanity's last hope rests on Captain Nova, a brilliant but clumsy astronaut, sent on a mission to harvest edible plants from a newly discovered, fertile moon named Xanadu.

Nova successfully gathers a diverse collection of alien flora, but a malfunction in the ship's cargo bay sends the food flying into space. Luckily, a friendly alien species, the Zorgons, witness the disaster and offer to help. Zorgons are friendly alient but they have chemical Y in their body . Chemical Y is very dangerous for human. But they have a technology to pull the food from a distance.

Now collect the foods and let the human civilization cook.
